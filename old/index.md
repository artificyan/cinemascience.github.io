## [](#header-2)Welcome

This is the project page for the Cinema project.  Cinema is an innovative way of capturing, storing and exploring both extreme scale scientific data and experimental data. It is a highly interactive image-based approach to data analysis and visualization that promotes investigation of large scientific datasets.  Cinema is easily integrated into your existing workflows through extensions to widely used open source tools. This novel approach supports interactive exploration of a wide range of data artifacts, while still significantly reducing data movement and storage.

All of our software is open source, and is available at the
[Cinema Science github](http://www.github.com/cinemascience)
